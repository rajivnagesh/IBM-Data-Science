# IBM Data Science Professional Certificate | Coursera

# Author : Rajiv Nagesh

Just started on Course 5 Databases and SQL for Data Science (as of 2/6/2020). All the coursework is aggregated into one repo.

To use the .ipynb file you will have to install Jupyter Notebook on your local machine or you can use online Jupyter Notebook which are easily available. 

Anyone may contribute after each assignment is turned in and graded. Feel free to submit a pull request.
